## Usage

**How to upload Sketch content for translation?** 

After you installed the Applanga Sketch Plugin and set up the Applanga Sketch integration as described in the Configuration section, open the Sketch file you want to translate. 

Start by uploading the translatable text content. In the Menu Bar under Plugins > Applanga choose Upload Strings. You can either upload all layers or only the currently selected one. 

After you made you chose the upload option form the Plugin menu, a pop-up will appear to ask you to select a source language (the current language of the file). The upload might take a moment. There will be a pop-up to confirm when the upload is done.  

The Applanga Sketch plugin can also upload the layers in the sketch file itself as a visual reference for the translation process to Applanga. For this feature, use the Upload Screenshots option from the plugin menu. <br><br>

**How to generate translated Sketch files?**

Once translations are available for your Sketch content on Applanga, you can use the plugin to generate a translated versions of your file. 

From the plugin menu, choose Download from Applanga. You will need to decide to either use the Draft version of the string or the Target version. 

**Important!** Before download resolved any *Missing Fonts* in your file. Translations won’t be displayed where fonts are missing. The string will remain unchanged (e.g. English)

In the pop-up that appears after that, select the language you want to download. When saving the file, using the .sketch ending in the file name is mandatory. <br><br>

**Uploading Translated Screenshots**

If you want to upload screenshots of your translated Sketch file back to Applanga, for example, if you want somebody to review the translation in-context, please follow these steps:

1. Go to Download from Applanga, chose either Target or Draft mode and select the language you want to download from the pop-up
2. After the download is finished, go to Upload Screenshots and in the pop-up select the language you want to upload translated screenshots to <br><br>

**Uploading Translated Screenshots for multiple languages**

With this option, you can start an automated process that will, step by step, download translations for a language, take screenshots of the translated Sketch design, and upload the translated screenshots back to Applanga for all languages selected one after the other automatically. 

In order to upload translated screenshots for multiple languages, in the plugin, chose the Batch Screenshot Upload option. In the subsection of the Batch option, you can select for which layer (all or only the currently selected) and which set of strings (Draft or Target) will be in scope for the batch process. 

After you confirmed the options you will be presented with a pop-up to enter which languages should be included. The languages need to exist in your project on the Applanga dashboard. By default, all languages in your project will be included. <br><br>
